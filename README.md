## About SymPy

SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external library.

## SymPy Tutorial for PyDelhi Conference 2016

This is the tutorial that SymPy developers will be giving at PyDelhi Conference 2016 for SymPy.
In this tutorial we will introduce attendees to SymPy, a computer aided algebra system (CAS) written in Python. We will show basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the last part of this tutorial, we will show how to solve practical problems with SymPy. This will include showing how to interface SymPy with popular numeric libraries like NumPy.

Attendees will take home an introductory level understanding of SymPy. This knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though hacking core modules may require additional expertise).
